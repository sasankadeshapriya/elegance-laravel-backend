PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
ADICOLOR CLASSICS 3-STRIPES TEE
A 3-STRIPES TEE WITH OG ATTITUDE.
What's a wardrobe without a classic tee? This adidas tee adds effortless style to your everyday look with a nod to OG sporty vibes. The single jersey construction creates a soft and comfortable fit, while 3-Stripes along the sleeves bring a touch of timeless heritage. We partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future. Better Cotton is sourced via a chain of custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, however, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we "source."

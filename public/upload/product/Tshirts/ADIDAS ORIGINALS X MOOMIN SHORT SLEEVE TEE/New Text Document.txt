PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
ADIDAS ORIGINALS X MOOMIN SHORT SLEEVE TEE
AN ADIDAS ORIGINALS X MOOMIN TEE FOR ALL-DAY COMFORT AND PLAYFUL STYLE.
Beloved Finnish fairytale characters the Moomins have been revelling in everyday adventures since 1947. This adidas Originals x Moomin tee pays tribute to them with a back graphic of Moomintroll trying his hand at ice skating. Soft cotton provides all-day comfort, and a banner graphic detailing adidas' time-honoured heritage finishes off the look. We partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future. Better Cotton is sourced via a chain of custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, however, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we "source".

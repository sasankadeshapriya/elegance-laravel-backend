ADIDAS ORIGINALS X HELLO KITTY HOODIE
A SOFT HOODIE WITH HELLO KITTY DETAILS EMBROIDERED HERE AND THERE.
At first glance, this adidas hoodie looks like comfort with a cosy hood. And it is. But look closer and you'll see embroidered Hello Kitty details, from her flowers to her face. With a handcrafted look, they tell the story of the beloved character. The heavyweight feel is from cotton French terry that's soft with the perfect drape. A wide ribbed hem coordinates with the cuffs. We partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future. Better Cotton is sourced via a chain of custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, however, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we "source."

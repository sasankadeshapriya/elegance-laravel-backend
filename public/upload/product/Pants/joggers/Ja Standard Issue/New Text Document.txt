Ja Standard Issue
Men's Dri-FIT Jogger Basketball Pants

Ja Morant is a self-made superstar. Away from the spotlight, Ja grew up tirelessly working on his game on his backyard court in South Carolina. From anonymous to All-Star, Nike celebrates the journey with his signature apparel collection. Nike Dri-FIT technology moves sweat away from your skin for quicker evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable. Ja's logo and graphics give our soft, relaxed-fit Standard Issue pants a signature finish.


Lightweight Comfort

Smooth on the outside with unbrushed loops on the inside, this midweight French terry helps create breathability, so itâ€™s comfy enough for you to wear all year long, no matter the temp.


Signature Ja

Part of a signature clothing collection that pays tribute to one of today's most exciting players, these pants feature Ja Morant's "JA" logo, plus "Morant" and "12" graphics inspired by his jersey number.

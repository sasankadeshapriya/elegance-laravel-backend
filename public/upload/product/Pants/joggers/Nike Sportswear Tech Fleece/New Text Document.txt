Nike Sportswear Tech Fleece
Men's Joggers

These comfy joggers bring back the signature slim fit you know for a tailored look. Our premium, smooth-on-both-sides fleece feels warmer and softer than ever, while keeping the same lightweight build you love. Tall ribbed cuffs pair with a zippered pocket on the right leg for secure storage and that signature Tech Fleece DNA. Pair them with the Tech Fleece hoodie for a uniform finish.


Iconic Design

With distinct details, like the paneled design, articulated knees and signature taped pocket at the right thigh, these joggers are unmistakably Tech Fleece.


Streamlined Fit

Tapering from the knee to ankle eliminates excess fabric and provides a fitted look to help your sneakers shine.


Signature Storage

Taped pocket has an interior organizer to help keep your things in place and easy to retrieve.


More Benefits

Soft elastic waistband with outer drawcord provides a snug fit you can cinch up and secure.

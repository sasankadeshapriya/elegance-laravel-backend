Nike Pro Warm
Men's Tights

Keep at your workout routine, even when the cold hits. We made these tights for warmth, with soft French terry to match the heat you bring to your reps. They're still stretchy in the right places, so you can keep at those lunges and squats without missing a step.


Benefits

French terry throughout adds smooth warmth.
A stretchy, mesh overlay at the knee let you move freely.
A media pocket at the right hip has enough space for most phones.
Flat seaming feels smooth against the skin.

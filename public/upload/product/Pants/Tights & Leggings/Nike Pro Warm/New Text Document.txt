Nike Pro Warm
Men's Tights

No need to rethink your work out when the cold weather hits. The Nike Pro Warm collection is about feeling confident being your bestâ€”even when the mercury starts to drop. These full-length tights are made with soft and stretchy French terry fabric, plus breathable panels around the knee.


Goodbye Sweat

Nike Dri-FIT technology moves sweat away from your skin for quicker evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable.


Made to Move

French terry fabric has a bit of stretch for a body-hugging feel that provides smooth warmth.


Airy Feel

Mesh panels behind the knee and lower back provides extra ventilation so you can stay cool where you need it.


More Benefits

Side pockets help store small items, like a card or keys.
Soft and stretchy waistband snugly sits above your hips.

Nike ACG "Smith Summit"
Men's Cargo Pants

We looked to Smith Rock to inspire us and came back with the light and durable Nike ACG "Smith Summit" Cargo Pants. They've got a loose feel and zip-off design that lets you convert them into shorts when the weather gets too hot. Plenty of pockets keep your gear close, while an included carabiner lets you latch your keys.


Northwest Tested, Smith Rock Inspired

This product was designed and tested in Oregon, USA. The state's vast wilderness and climate has served as inspiration for our designs. To create these pants, our team went to Smith Rock—a rock climbing playground in Central Oregon—to connect with the environment and learn how it can inform our gear and how we use it.


Move Easy, Stay Dry

Tough-but-stretchy woven fabric and reinforced seams help you move freely. Plus, the water-repellent finish helps keep you dry and comfortable through a variety of conditions.


Durable and Versatile

Cordura® fabric at the knees provides tough durability. Shaped seams help keep you moving freely. When your hike heats up, the pants detach at the knees and convert into shorts.


Stow and Go

Pockets offer trail-ready storage. Extra drop-in pockets at the side and a back pocket help keep your valuables close.


Adjust and Attach

The elastic, high-rise waistband has a lightweight, webbed belt with a quick-release G-hook buckle to help you adjust the fit. A ACG-branded carabiner connects to a waistband loop on the wearer's right side.


More Benefits

Front fly with a hidden snap at the waistband.
Drawcords at the hem help adjust the fit.

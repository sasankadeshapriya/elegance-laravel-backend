PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
ORIGINALS MOOMIN WINTER SWEATPANTS
ADIDAS ORIGINALS X MOOMIN SWEATPANTS FOR COSY COMFORT ON CHILLY DAYS.
Beloved Finnish characters the Moomins have been revelling in everyday adventures since 1947. In playful graphics on these pants, Moomins enjoy the wintry outdoors. Whether you're heading out or just hanging out at home, these adidas sweatpants let you slip into endless comfort thanks to soft French terry. We partner with Better Cotton to improve cotton farming globally. Better Cotton makes global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the sector's future. Better Cotton is sourced via a chain of custody model called mass balance. This means that Better Cotton is not physically traceable to end products, however, Better Cotton Farmers benefit from the demand for Better Cotton in equivalent volumes to those we "source".
